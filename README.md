# Mock School Gradebook
A teacher and student portal to view and add grades. The teacher can add grades to an existing student or create a new student. Students can view the grade of an individual assignment or their final grade.
## Usage
1.  Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the folder containing **login.py** through the command line.
3. Type **python login.py** into the command line, press **enter/return**, and follow the prompts to run the *Mock School Gradebook*.
### Note
There is no database so student portal interactions only work on hardcoded student object examples.  The program is case-sensitive.
